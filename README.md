# reinforcement-learning-algorithms
This repository contains implementation and write-up of several algorithms for testing purposes.

## Install requirements
The `requirements.txt` or conda environemnt `rl.yml` can be found in the root directory. For the installation of the OpenAI gym make sure to follow the [installation](https://github.com/openai/gym#installation) instructions.

## Available Algorithms (WIP)
A good global scope of different Reinforcement Learning algorithms can be found in: [RL Taxonomy](https://github.com/bennylp/RL-Taxonomy).
